## The Last Survivors â€” a Minetest/MultiCraft server

Originally created by dew and yayyer through the help of MarisaG from which she hosted for a while before hosting was transferred to r1bnc. It shares the same host with Resistance, another Minetest/MultiCraft server owned by r1bnc and dew.

This server features mods duly customized to its owners and players' taste, catering to listen to its community's suggestions with no bias. Some of them include but are not limited to:
- ethereal
- ethereal bosses
- xpro
- gemstones
- ice armor and tools
- realistic glider
- hot air balloons
- basic machines
- vacuum
- spacesuit
